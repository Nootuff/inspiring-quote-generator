# Inspiring Quote Generator readme

[The Inspiring Quote Generator](https://nootuff.github.io/inspiring-quote-generator/) is a website built with **Javascript** and **Jquery**. Using **Axios**, the site pulls inspirational quotes from [an API](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json) & displays them along with their author. The site also allows users to tweet their favourite quotes directly using Twitter’s web intent feature.

The site’s background image changes with each quote generation. The image details are also displayed to credit the original photographer, updating with each new image. All images are supplied by the royalty free image site [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
